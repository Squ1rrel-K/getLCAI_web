Description: By using the mRNA expression profile data, you can analyze the 
    action direction of target gene regulation or drug treatment on the 
    progression of lung cancer, so as to clearly indicate the cancer inhibition 
    effect or cancer promoting effect of this research factor (gene or drug). 
    The Euclidean distance is calculated by three-dimensional PCA to quantify 
    the effect of processing factors, so as to quantify and compare the function
    of genes or drugs. This R package plays an important role in screening lung 
    cancer target genes and targeted drugs.
